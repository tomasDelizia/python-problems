# Pythong Programming Exercises

This project contains a collection of solutions to common programming problems in Python. It is organized into different
packages covering topics such as arrays, matrices, data structures, and classic algorithms.

## Project Structure

- `src/arrays/`: Utilities and algorithms for working with arrays (searching, sorting,
  merging).
- `src/backtracking/`: Backtracking algorithms for problems like 8-Queens.
- `src/dynamic/`: Dynamic programming solutions for problems like Fibonacci sequence,
  coin change, and longest common subsequence.
- `src/graph/`: Implementation of Graph data structure.
- `src/greedy/`: Greedy algorithms for problems like coin change.
- `src/hash/`: Implementation of hash table with separate chaining collision resolution
  technique.
- `src/heap/`: Implementations of binary heap, a.k.a. a priority queue.
- `src/linkedlist/`: Implementations of singly and doubly linked lists, along with
  common operations.
- `src/matrix/`: Functions for matrix manipulation and operations.
- `src/queue/`: Implementation of a queue data structure.
- `src/recursion/`: Examples of recursive algorithms and problems.
- `src/sort/`: Various sorting algorithms including quicksort and mergesort.
- `src/stack/`: Implementation of a stack data structure.
- `src/string/`: String manipulation and searching algorithms.
- `src/tree/`: Binary search tree and n-ary tree implementations, along with traversal
  algorithms.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- `pip` for package management.
- `unittest` for running tests.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tomasDelizia/python-problems.git
   ```
2. Enter the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd python-problems
   ```
3. Run the tests to ensure everything is working:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py"
   ```

## Folder Structure
